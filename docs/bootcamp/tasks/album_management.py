# Learning Objective:
# - Practiced more of my object-oriented programming (OOP) including 
#   class creation, instance/special methods, and object manipulation.
# - Work with lists, sorting, and searching algorithms in Python.
# - Understand how to use Python's built-in functions like 
#  `sort`, `extend`, and `enumerate`.
# - Trying new special methods (dunder methods) to improve my submission.

# <------Reflection-----> 
# This task helped me practise Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python
# by designing this Album class with a constructor and a __str__ method for 
# better object representation. 

# I feel like I improved my skills in manipulating and organising data using
# lists of objects. I also gained experience with Pythonâ€™s built-in functions
# like sort, extend, and enumerate, learning to sort lists with custom keys 
# (e.g., number_of_songs or album_name) and search using loops with enumerate.

# A key challenge was correctly implementing the sort method with custom keys,
#  but experimenting with lambda functions helped me overcome it.
